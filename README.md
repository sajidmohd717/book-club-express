In the process i'm creating a detailed notion document on how to start up an express js server, so anything in the future i just refer to this notes

going to be robust notes like my notes for reactjs

currently following along this course:
- MERN Stack Tutorial - Book Store Project

but i should also cross reference to find the best solution so i'm also referring to this
- MERN Stack Project | Fullstack Tutorial
